- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigTuck92
- 👀 I’m interested in anything fun and nerdy. I'm a D&D Game Master for two games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a Full Stack Developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on school projects at the moment, but who knows what will come once I have the knowledge base.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Direct message works fine...
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a Phlebotomist for nearly a decade and have finally worked up the courage to switch careers and jump back into coding.
